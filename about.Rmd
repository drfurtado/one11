Welcome to my academic blog. I am an associate professor at [Cal State Northridge](https://csun.edu) where I teach courses related to Kinesiology. I earned my M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Motor Behavior from the University of Pittsburgh, PA. Dr. My line of research focuses on two main areas: (1) validation of observational models in psychomotor assessment instruments and (2) the relationship between motor skill competence, perceived motor competence, physical activity levels, and body composition.

I often post on the topics related to: a) Statistics, b) SPSS and _R_ Software, c) Online teaching, d) Motor Behavior, e) Motor skill assessment.
